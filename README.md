# Image-recognition-
in this project I made three different codes for the recognition of the handwritten numbers that are in the form of images using the [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). The three codes are:
1. Image recognition CNN
2. Image recognition algorithm CNN
3. Image recognition algorithm

## 1. Image recognition CNN
1. Image recognition CNN: in this code I make the comparison between the number of iterations of the optimization weights and the Accuracy of the algorithm and I found that more than one increases the number of iterations more that the accuracy increases and I reached the following result: nbr_iteration = 10 000 implies Accuracy = 91.1


## 2. Image recognition algorithm CNN
In this code I used [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) for handwritten number recognition[MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) whose result is Accuracy = 0.9764


## 3. Image recognition algorithm
In this code I used [neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) for handwritten number recognition [MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) whose result is Accuracy = 0.9473
